# PrismAI

**PrismAI** is an experimental reasoning engine that blends **artificial intelligence with timeless philosophical wisdom**.  
The system is designed to act not just as a tool for generating answers, but as a **companion for reflection, reasoning, and personal growth**.

## 🌌 Vision

Modern AI systems are often fast and fluent, but rarely **trustworthy, explainable, or deeply human-centric**.  
PrismAI was created to address this gap by bringing the voices of great philosophers into the design of multi-agent systems.  
The aim is simple yet ambitious:

> **"To bring great philosophers and their philosophies to life — guiding users toward clarity, ethical reasoning, and better decision-making."**

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

PrismAI operates through a set of **philosophical agents**, each inspired by a thinker whose perspective shaped human civilization.  
Instead of offering shallow answers, the agents collaborate and critique one another — producing responses that are **layered, explainable, and grounded in enduring ideas**.

Examples of agent personas:
- **Socratic Agent** → Encourages questioning assumptions through dialogue.  
- **Aristotelian Agent** → Balances logic with practical ethics.  
- **Kantian Agent** → Focuses on duty, principles, and universal rules.  
- **Nietzschean Agent** → Challenges conventions, sparking creativity and resilience.  
- **Confucian Agent** → Anchors decisions in harmony, community, and responsibility.

This constellation of agents allows PrismAI to **simulate philosophical debate**, helping users see multiple perspectives before arriving at a conclusion.
